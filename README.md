# OpenCV
Hello everyone, I'm Keops, a mechatronics engineer. I'll share with you my progress and everything I've learned in my courses and academic training. I want to let you know that I'm learning English, and I apologize for any mistakes I may make when writing.

To use the codes you need to have the following libraries previously installed:

pip install opencv-contrib-python

pip install pyqt5

pip install numpy
